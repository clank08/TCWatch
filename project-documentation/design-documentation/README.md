# True Crime Tracker - Design Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive design specifications for the True Crime tracking application, a cross-platform mobile app that helps enthusiasts discover, track, and discuss True Crime content across streaming services and cable networks.

## Project Context

**Target Audience**: True Crime enthusiasts aged 25-55 consuming content across multiple platforms
**Primary Platforms**: React Native/Expo (iOS, Android, Web)
**Core Value Proposition**: Unified tracking and discovery across 200+ streaming services and cable networks

## Table of Contents

### Foundation
- [Design System & Style Guide](design-system/style-guide.md) - Complete design system specifications
- [Design Tokens](design-system/tokens/) - Colors, typography, spacing, and animations
- [Component Library](design-system/components/) - Reusable UI components
- [Platform Adaptations](design-system/platform-adaptations/) - iOS, Android, and Web specific patterns

### Features
- [User Onboarding](features/user-onboarding/) - Account creation and interest profiling
- [Content Discovery](features/content-discovery/) - Search and browsing experiences
- [Content Tracking](features/content-tracking/) - Watchlist and progress management
- [Social Features](features/social-features/) - Privacy-first community features
- [Notifications](features/notifications/) - Alerts and content updates

### Accessibility & Quality
- [Accessibility Guidelines](accessibility/guidelines.md) - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
- [Testing Procedures](accessibility/testing.md) - Quality assurance processes
- [Implementation Notes](accessibility/compliance.md) - Developer handoff guidance

## Design Philosophy

Our design embodies:

- **Investigative Atmosphere**: Dark, sophisticated themes reflecting the serious nature of True Crime content
- **Content-First Discovery**: Prioritizing content over platform, cases over individual shows
- **Privacy-Focused Social**: Community features with granular privacy controls
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified experience across streaming services and cable networks
- **Accessibility-Driven**: Universal usability with high contrast and clear navigation

## Key Design Principles

1. **Bold Simplicity**: Intuitive navigation creating frictionless content discovery
2. **Strategic Negative Space**: Breathing room for dense content information
3. **Systematic Color Theory**: Dark themes with purposeful accent placement
4. **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture for complex metadata
5. **Motion Choreography**: Physics-based transitions maintaining spatial continuity
6. **Feedback Responsiveness**: Clear system status communication

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
- All measurements provided in rem/px for precise implementation
- Component specifications include all states (default, hover, focus, disabled, loading)
- Cross-references to design tokens for consistency
- Platform-specific adaptation notes included

### For QA Testing
- Accessibility checklists with WCAG compliance verification
- User flow validation criteria
- Performance benchmarks and optimization targets
- Device-specific testing requirements

## Getting Started

1. **Review Foundation**: Start with [Design System & Style Guide](design-system/style-guide.md)
2. **Understand User Flows**: Examine feature-specific user journeys
3. **Implement Components**: Use component specifications for consistent UI
4. **Test Accessibility**: Follow accessibility guidelines and testing procedures
5. **Validate Experience**: Use success metrics and user validation criteria

## Maintenance & Updates

This documentation is a living system that evolves with the product:

- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning for all design updates
- **Change Tracking**: Update logs and rationale for design decisions
- **Cross-References**: Bidirectional links between related documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Regular audits for consistency and accuracy

## Success Metrics

Design success will be measured by:
- **User Retention**: 60% Day 7, 40% Day 30 retention rates
- **Task Completion**: 85% success rate for core user flows
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% WCAG AA standard adherence
- **Performance**: <2s page load times, 60fps interactions
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on content discovery and tracking experience
