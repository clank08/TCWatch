# Content Tracking Feature - Design Overview

## Executive Summary

The content tracking feature is the core functionality of the True Crime tracker, enabling users to maintain comprehensive viewing records across 200+ streaming platforms and cable networks. This feature prioritizes frictionless tracking updates, meaningful progress visualization, and privacy-first social features that support the serious, investigative nature of True Crime content.

## Feature Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Support all viewing statuses across multiple platforms
- **Effortless Updates**: Quick, one-tap status changes and progress tracking
- **Meaningful Insights**: Visual progress indicators and viewing statistics
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Seamless experience across devices and platforms
- **Privacy-First Social**: Opt-in sharing with granular privacy controls

### Success Metrics
- 80% of users track 5+ pieces of content within first 30 days
- Average 2+ tracking updates per user per week
- 95% of status updates completed in under 3 taps
- 60% of users utilize progress tracking for episodic content
- 30% adoption of social tracking features within 60 days

## Core Tracking Capabilities

### 1. Watch Status System
**Five primary states aligned with True Crime viewing patterns:**

- **Want to Watch** - Content identified but not yet started
- **Currently Watching** - Actively viewing, with episode-level progress
- **Completed** - Fully watched with rating and review options
- **On Hold** - Temporarily paused, common for heavy/disturbing content
- **Abandoned** - Started but decided not to continue

### 2. Progress Tracking
**Granular progress for different content types:**

- **Movies/Documentaries**: Binary completion with viewing date
- **Series**: Season and episode-level tracking with timestamps
- **Limited Series**: Episode progress with overall completion percentage
- **Podcasts**: Episode tracking with time-based progress

### 3. Personal Metadata
**Research-focused tracking for serious enthusiasts:**

- **Personal Rating**: 5-star system with half-star precision
- **Private Notes**: Unlimited text for research and analysis
- **Custom Tags**: User-defined tags for case organization
- **Key Takeaways**: Structured notes for important insights
- **Viewing Dates**: Complete viewing history with timestamps

### 4. Social Features (Privacy-First)
**Community engagement with respect for content sensitivity:**

- **Public Lists**: Curated recommendations with optional commentary
- **Friend Activity**: Opt-in sharing of ratings and completions
- **Collaborative Lists**: Shared research lists for trusted connections
- **Private Mode**: Complete privacy for all tracking activity
