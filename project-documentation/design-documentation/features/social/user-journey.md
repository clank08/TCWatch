# Social Features - Complete User Journey

## Overview

The social features enable True Crime enthusiasts to connect, share research, and collaborate while maintaining strict privacy controls and respectful discourse about serious criminal cases. Every social feature is designed with privacy-first principles and opt-in participation, ensuring users maintain complete control over their data and interactions.

## Design Philosophy

**Privacy-First Architecture**: All social features are private by default with explicit opt-in for any data sharing. Users maintain granular control over every aspect of their social presence.

**Investigative Community Focus**: Social interactions center around research, case analysis, and thoughtful content curation rather than entertainment or casual discussion.

**Respectful Discourse**: All social features are designed to maintain the serious, investigative tone appropriate for True Crime content, with respect for victims and families.

## Primary User Goals

- **Connect with fellow researchers** who share similar case interests
- **Share curated content lists** for research and recommendation
- **Collaborate on case research** through shared lists and notes
- **Discover quality content** through trusted community connections
- **Maintain privacy control** while participating in community activities
- **Engage in respectful discussion** about cases and investigations

## Success Criteria

- 30% of users opt into social features within 60 days
- 85% of social interactions remain respectful and research-focused
- Users create and share an average of 2.5 lists within 90 days
- Friend connections result in 40% more content discovery
- Privacy controls are actively used by 90% of social users
