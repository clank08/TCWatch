2. **Universal Search Across Platforms** - Core value proposition
3. **Content Tracking (4 statuses)** - Primary user need
4. **Basic Rating System** - User engagement and data collection
5. **Platform Integration (Netflix, Hulu, Investigation Discovery)** - Minimum viable content coverage
6. **Mobile-Responsive Web App** - Accessibility and device coverage
7. **Basic Notifications** - New content alerts for followed cases

**Rationale**: These features enhance the core experience and provide differentiation, but aren't required for basic functionality.

### P2 Features (Nice-to-Have for Future)

1. **Public Social Features** - Community building
2. **Community Challenges** - Gamification and engagement
3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Power user insights
4. **Content Export/Backup** - Data portability
