## Notes

1. Phases can have some overlap, especially after Phase 4 where frontend and backend can work in parallel
2. Each phase should have a demo/review at completion
3. Security and performance should be considered throughout, not just in Phase 9
4. Documentation should be updated continuously
5. User feedback should be gathered and integrated starting from Phase 5
6. Consider soft launch with beta users after Phase 8

## Testing Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features when possible
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for all new code
- Critical paths must have 95%+ coverage

### Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated component testing
2. **Integration Tests (20%)**: Service and API interaction testing
3. **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical user journey validation

### Continuous Testing
- All tests run automatically on every commit
- Broken tests block merges to main branch
- Performance regression tests run nightly
- Security scans run on every deployment

### Testing Standards
- Tests must be readable and maintainable
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Tests should run in under 10 minutes for PR checks
- E2E tests can run longer but must complete within 30 minutes
